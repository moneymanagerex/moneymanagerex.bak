<h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
Money Manager Ex© is a free, easy-to-use personal finance software to manage your money matters. 
It primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when and how the money
goes and comes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Think of Money Manager Ex (<b>MMEX</b>) as a computer checkbook which enables you to
balance your accounts, organize, manage and generate reports for your finances.
</p>
<p>
It is also a great way to keep abreast of your financial worth.
</p>
<p>
The primary goal of MMEX is to simplify the process of tracking financial
information without making it complex like some of the popular personal finance
software packages.
</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="better">Working towards better Financial Health</a></h3>
<p>Becoming organized financially requires some amount of discipline. Most of the
time, the reason financial management becomes complicated is because there is no
clear understanding of cash flow or the amount of income to the expenses. Debt
is usually what results when expenses exceed income.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The first step towards better financial organization is keeping good records.
Only when there is recognition of the expenses being made on a day to day basis
will there be an understanding on how to cut back.</p>
<p>Did you realize you spent 600$ in buying DVD movies last year? How many times
did you watch them? Do you think now that the 600$ would have been better spent
on the unexpected maintenance on the auto that came up yesterday? Of course
there is no right or wrong answer to how you should spend your money. After all,
it is you who earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way you see
fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you. You want better
&quot;bang for your buck/lira/pound&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you slice/dice the
financial data to give you better insight into what is going on. Always remember
the software can only be as good as the data it has to process. What goes in
comes out. But if you have started thinking of even using a Personal finance
software you are well on your way to making every dollar count.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on how to work with Money Manager Ex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="concepts">Money Manager Ex Concepts</a></h3>
<p>Money Manager Ex models the real financial world through concepts of
transactions. A transaction is an financial event where money/services are
exchanged. Such transactions could be making a payment towards a loan, buying a
car, eating out at a restaurant and so on. Each transaction is associated with
an <i>account</i> and a <i>category</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An <i>account</i> is a record of what you either own or owe. For example,
your checking account is a record of cash on deposit in the bank that is
available for writing checks or for making ATM withdrawals or for making debit
transactions using a debit card. A credit card account is a record of the money
you owe to a credit card company for the use of the credit card. All
transactions either increase or decrease the balance in one or more
accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <i>category</i> is a record of where the money comes from or goes to. For
example, salary is an income category for recording the money you earn from your
job. Dining is an expense category you might use to record the cost of eating
out. Categories make it possible to track how you earn and spend money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make MMEX work effectively, it is important to record all transactions
made by you into the appropriate accounts. Even if you do not have the habit of
carefully entering transactions, you should enter transactions when you get your
monthly statement from your credit card company or bank.</p>
<p>Once you enter your transactions, MMEX can help provide some useful
information to you. For example, it will tell you what the current balance on
your accounts are. It will provide information on how much you are spending
versus how much you are earning. All this knowledge would help you make better
decisions.</p>
<p>To begin working with Money Manager, you should start by creating a new
database file. All the transactions you record with MMEX are stored in a
database file (file with an extension of .mmb) on your hard disk. This file
contains all the components- accounts, categories, transactions that make up
your financial status.</p>
<p>Although it is possible to create more than one MMEX data file, it isn't
usually necessary. One file can hold all your transactions and accounts. There
is no limit to the number of accounts or transactions that you can have in your
database file. The only time it might make sense to have more than one database
file is if you use MMEX to organize your personal finance and the finances of
the small business firm you have. Or if you share the computer with another
person and your maintain separate financial records from them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="database">Creating a Database</a></h3>
<p>To create a new database file, on the Menu, Select File-&gt;New Database.
This will prompt you to specify the location of the .mmb file. Once you select
the location a new database is created. You can now see the database name on the 
title bar which helps remind you which database file is open. Remember to make backups of your .mmb.
One thing to remember about the .mmb file is that they are not encrypted. That
means anyone else having the proper know how can actually open the file and read
the contents. So make sure that if you are storing any sensitive financial
information it is properly guarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="accounts">Creating new accounts</a></h3>
<p>Right after you create a new database file, the first thing to do is to
create a new account. Currently, MMEX supports the type of accounts that support
three kinds of transactions, withdrawal, deposit and transfers. This account is
termed a &quot;Checking&quot; account. These kinds of
accounts cover common bank accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, cash
accounts and credit card accounts. To properly setup accounts, you should have
balance information for the the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You can get
this information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
statements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a new account, on the Menu, Select Accounts-&gt;New Account. This
will bring up the create account dialog window. You can create a new account by
filling in the details.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The required fields are the name of the account and the currency you want to
use. The recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to the
real world account. Say for example you have an account with CitiBank, you could
name your account &quot;CitiBank&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The only type of account that is currently supported is checking accounts.</p>
<p>To track additional information about this account, optionally you can enter
your account details such as Account Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and
Access Info. You can enter additional notes about the account in the notes
field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most accounts have some kind of balance in them, for example say in a credit
card account, you have a current balance of 2304.67$, you could put that value
in the initial balance field. Going forward you only need to add transactions
beyond that date when you had the balance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Accounts have status associated with them which could &quot;Open&quot; or
&quot;Closed&quot;. Closed accounts are just that. They are no longer active.
Setting this status is just a way to de clutter your view so that you do not
have to see the closed accounts in your tree view navigation pane.<br>
<br>
In addition you can set the currency that is associated with your account. MMEX
comes with a default set of currencies which you can add to correspond to your
countries currency settings.</p>
<p>You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite Account'. This again is used to
change the accounts that are visible in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>The other type of account that MMEX supports is an &quot;Investment&quot;
Account. These accounts are store information on financial institutions where
you hold any type of stock/bonds/mutual funds investments.</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="editaccounts">Editing Account Information</a></h3>
<p>Once you have created an account, you can edit any of the account information
fields by selecting the account name in the navigation pane and then right click
to bring up the popup menu. Select &quot;Edit Account&quot; to bring up the
account information dialog. Edit the information and then click &quot;OK&quot;
to save the account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>
<br>

<h3><a name="trans">Creating new Transactions</a></h3>
<p>Once you have created a new account, one can start entering transactions.
Select the account you want to enter transactions into by left clicking the
account in the navigation tree. This opens the register of transactions
associated with this account. To create a new transaction, click the
&quot;New&quot; button to open up the transaction dialog. Enter the details
associated with this transactions. Select by selecting type of transaction from
&quot;Withdrawal&quot;, &quot;Deposit&quot; or &quot;Transfer&quot;. Then select
the payee, category, the transaction date, number, any notes and then the
transaction amount. Press &quot;OK&quot; button to save the transaction.<br>
<br>
Here are some notes on the fields associated with the transaction dialog.<br>
<i>Transaction Type</i>: Withdrawal transaction type is one where one makes an
expense. Deposit transaction type is an income transaction. Transfer transaction
type is one where a withdrawal is made from one account and is deposited into
another account.<br>
<br>
<i>Payee</i>: Payee is to whom the money goes or comes from. Clicking the payee
button opens up the payee dialog. You can select the payee from that dialog or
create a new payee.</p>
<p>Category: Category selects the kind of expense/income for the transaction.
Clicking the category button opens up the category dialog. You can select the
category from the dialog or create a new category.</p>
<p>Transaction Number: is a field to enter any kind of number associated with
the transaction like check number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transaction Status: Select from &quot;Unreconciled&quot;,
&quot;Reconciled&quot;, &quot;Void&quot;, &quot;Flag for Followup&quot; status
options.&nbsp;<br>
This marks the transactions into various states.&nbsp;<br>
<i><u>Unreconciled</u></i>: When you enter a transaction, it initially is in the state of
&quot;Unreconciled&quot;. Which means the transaction has not been reconciled
with your bank/credit card company's balance.&nbsp;<br>
<i><u>Reconciled</u></i>: Once the transaction is checked and verified with a credit card
company's balance information, it can be marked as reconciled.&nbsp;<br>
<i><u>
Void</u></i>: If you entered a transaction that later became invalid or you canceled
the transaction, instead of deleting the transaction you can also mark it as
void so you have a record of the transaction.<br>
<i><u>
Flag For Followup</u></i>: This status marks transactions as needing more action. For
example, you receive a balance statement from the financial institution and you
notice that the transaction amount is different between what you recorded and
what is in the statement. You can mark it as flag for follow up so that you can
followup with the financial instituton.</p>

a transaction can be considered reconciled if the details of the transaction match that from the financial 
institution. Then the transaction can be marked as reconciled. By marking these transactions you 
can keep track whether the transactions you are entering match the actual transactions. In MMEX, 
reconciled and unreconciled transactions are shown by different icons.</p>

<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<h3><a name="nameex">What's the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</a></h3>
<p>
Originally I developed a personal finance software called Money Manager. It was written in .NET and more
of a learning excercise than serious software development. It grew far beyond the original design.
The software was frozen and work began on a new version which had a similar user interface and features.&nbsp; 
</p><p>
Usually Microsoft names their second version of their improved software APIs 
with an Ex extension as in doSomething() and doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and tacked on a 'Ex'
to the end.
</p>
<h5><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></h5>

<h3><a name="database">Is the .mmb format proprietary?</</a></h3>
<p>
No. In case you don't know, MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That means that
the .mmb file is a regular SQLite database. SQLite is one of the smallest, free relational database systems
around and there are tons of tools to open and access sqlite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
are two such utilities. Once you open the database using these tools, you can do anything you want
with the data.
