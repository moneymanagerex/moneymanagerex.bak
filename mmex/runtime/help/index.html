<p>
<font face="Verdana">Money Manager Ex&copy; is a free,
easy-to-use personal finance software to manage your money. It
primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when
and how the money
goes and comes.&nbsp;
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana">Think of Money Manager Ex (<b>MMEX</b>)
as a computer checkbook which enables you to
balance your accounts, organize, manage and generate reports for your
finances.
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana">It is also a great way to keep
abreast of your financial worth.
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Verdana">The primary goal of MMEX is to
simplify the process of tracking financial
information without making it complex like some of the popular personal
finance
software packages.
</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="better">Working
towards better Financial Health</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">Becoming organized
financially requires some amount of discipline. Financial management
becomes complicated because
there is no clear understanding of cash flow or an idea of income
against
expenses. Debt
is usually what results when expenses exceed income.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

The first step towards better financial organization is keeping good
records.
Only when there is recognition of the expenses being made on a day to
day basis
will there be an understanding on how to cut back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Did you realize you spent
600$ in buying DVD movies last year? How many times
did you watch them? Do you think now that the 600$ would have been
better spent
on the unexpected maintenance on the auto that came up yesterday? Of
course
there is no right or wrong answer to how you should spend your money.
After all,
it is you who earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way
you see
fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you. You want
better
"bang for your buck/lira/pound".<br>

<br>

Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
slice/dice the
financial data to give you better insight into what is going on. Always
remember
the software can only be as good as the data it has to process. Garbage
In Garbage Out. But if you have started thinking of even using a
Personal finance
software you are well on your way to making every dollar
count.&nbsp;</font></p>

</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="concepts">Money
Manager Ex Concepts</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">Money Manager Ex models the
real financial world through concepts of
transactions. A <b><i>transaction</i></b>is an
financial
event where money/services are
exchanged. Such transactions could be making a payment towards a loan,
buying a
car, eating out at a restaurant and so on. Each transaction is
associated with
an <i>account</i> and a <i>category</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>

<font face="Verdana"><img src="mmex_concept.png">
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">An <b><i>account
</i></b> is a record of
what you either own or owe. For example,
your checking account is a record of cash on deposit in the bank that
is
available for writing checks or for making ATM withdrawals or for
making debit
transactions using a debit card. A credit card account is a record of
the money
you owe to a credit card company for the use of the credit card. All
transactions either increase or decrease the balance in one or more
accounts.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">A <i style="font-weight: bold;">category</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>is a record of
where the money comes from or goes to. For
example, salary is an income category for recording the money you earn
from your
job. Dining is an expense category you might use to record the cost of
eating
out. Categories make it possible to track how you earn and spend
money.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">To make MMEX work
effectively, it is important to record all transactions
made by you into the appropriate accounts. Even if you do not have the
habit of
carefully entering transactions, you should enter transactions when you
get your
monthly statement from your credit card company or bank.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Once you enter your
transactions, MMEX can help provide some useful
information to you. For example, it will tell you what the current
balance on
your accounts are. It will provide information on how much you are
spending
versus how much you are earning. All this knowledge would help you make
better
decisions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">To begin working with Money
Manager, you should start by creating a new
database file. All the transactions you record with MMEX are stored in
a
database file (file with an extension of .mmb) on your hard disk. This
file
contains all the components- accounts, categories, transactions that
make up
your financial status.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Although it is possible to
create more than one MMEX data file, it isn't
usually necessary. One file can hold all your transactions and
accounts. There
is no limit to the number of accounts or transactions that you can have
in your
database file. The only time it might make sense to have more than one
database
file is if you use MMEX to organize your personal finance and the
finances of
the small business firm you have. Or if you share the computer with
another
person and your maintain separate financial records from them.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

<font face="Verdana"><br>

</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="database">Creating
a Database</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">To create a new database
file, on the Menu, Select File-&gt;New Database.
This will prompt you to specify the location of the .mmb file. Once you
select
the location a new database is created. You can now see the database
name on the title bar which helps remind you which database file is
open.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tips:&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>1) Remember to make
backups of your .mmb.&nbsp;<br>

2) The .mmb file is&nbsp;not encrypted. That
means anyone else having the proper know how can actually open the file
and read
the contents. So make sure that if you are storing any sensitive
financial
information it is properly guarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h5><font face="Verdana"><a href="#top">Back

<font face="Verdana"><br>

</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="accounts">Creating
new accounts</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">Right after you create a new
database file, the first thing to do is to
create a new account. Currently, MMEX supports two types of accounts.
One type of account is those that support
three kinds of transactions, withdrawal, deposit and transfers. This
account is
termed a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Checking</span>"
account. These kinds of
accounts cover common bank accounts, checking accounts, savings
accounts, cash
accounts and credit card accounts. The other type of account is a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Investment</span>"
account. This is a type of account which allows you to track stocks and
other investments you may own.<br>

<br>

To properly setup accounts, you should have
balance information for the the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You
can get
this information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
statements.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">To create a new account, on
the Menu, Select Accounts-&gt;New Account. This
will bring up the create account dialog window. You can create a new
account by
filling in the details.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

The required fields are the name of the account and the currency you
want to
use. The recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in
relation to the
real world account. Say for example you have an account with CitiBank,
you could
name your account "CitiBank".&nbsp;<br>

<br>

The only type of account that is currently supported is checking
accounts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">To track additional
information about this account, optionally you can enter
your account details such as Account Number, Held At, Website, Contact
info and
Access Info. You can enter additional notes about the account in the
notes
field.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Most accounts have some kind
of balance in them, for example say in a credit
card account, you have a current balance of 2304.67$, you could put
that value
in the initial balance field. Going forward you only need to add
transactions
beyond that date when you had the balance.&nbsp;<br>

<br>

Accounts have status associated with them which could "Open" or
"Closed". Closed accounts are just that. They are no longer active.
Setting this status is just a way to de clutter your view so that you
do not
have to see the closed accounts in your tree view navigation pane.<br>

<br>

In addition you can set the currency that is associated with your
account. MMEX
comes with a default set of currencies which you can add to correspond
to your
countries currency settings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">You also can mark accounts
as a 'Favorite Account'. This again is used to
change the accounts that are visible in the navigation bar.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">The other type of account
that MMEX supports is an "Investment"
Account. These accounts are store information on financial institutions
where
you hold any type of stock/bonds/mutual funds investments.</font></p>

</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="editaccounts">Editing
Account Information</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">Once you have created an
account, you can edit any of the account information
fields by selecting the account name in the navigation pane and then
right click
to bring up the popup menu. Select "Edit Account" to bring up the
account information dialog. Edit the information and then click "OK"
to save the account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="trans">Creating
new Transactions</a></font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana">Once you have created a new
account, one can start entering transactions.
Select the account you want to enter transactions into by left clicking
the
account in the navigation tree. This opens the register of transactions
associated with this account. To create a new transaction, click the
"New" button to open up the transaction dialog. Enter the details
associated with this transactions. Select by selecting type of
transaction from
"Withdrawal", "Deposit" or "Transfer". Then select
the payee, category, the transaction date, number, any notes and then
the
transaction amount. Press "OK" button to save the transaction.<br>

<br>

Here are some notes on the fields associated with the transaction
dialog.<br>

<i>Transaction Type</i>: Withdrawal transaction type is one
where one makes an
expense. Deposit transaction type is an income transaction. Transfer
transaction
type is one where a withdrawal is made from one account and is
deposited into
another account.<br>

<br>

<i>Payee</i>: Payee is to whom the money goes or comes
from. Clicking the payee
button opens up the payee dialog. You can select the payee from that
dialog or
create a new payee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Category: Category selects
the kind of expense/income for the transaction.
Clicking the category button opens up the category dialog. You can
select the
category from the dialog or create a new category.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Transaction Number: is a
field to enter any kind of number associated with
the transaction like check number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Transaction Status: Select
from "Unreconciled",
"Reconciled", "Void", "Flag for Followup" status
options.&nbsp;<br>

This marks the transactions into various states.&nbsp;<br>

<i><u>Unreconciled</u></i>: When you enter a
transaction, it initially is in the state of
"Unreconciled". Which means the transaction has not been reconciled
with your bank/credit card company's balance.&nbsp;<br>

<i><u>Reconciled</u></i>: Once the transaction
is checked and verified with a credit card
company's balance information, it can be marked as reconciled.&nbsp;<br>

<i><u>
Void</u></i>: If you entered a transaction that later
became invalid or you canceled
the transaction, instead of deleting the transaction you can also mark
it as
void so you have a record of the transaction.<br>

<i><u>
Flag For Followup</u></i>: This status marks transactions
as needing more action. For
example, you receive a balance statement from the financial institution
and you
notice that the transaction amount is different between what you
recorded and
what is in the statement. You can mark it as flag for follow up so that
you can
followup with the financial instituton.</font></p>

a transaction can be considered reconciled if the details of the
transaction match that from the financial institution. Then the

version of their improved software APIs with an Ex extension as in

MMEX uses SQLite databases to store user data. That means that

SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
are two such utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
you can do anything you want
with the data. </a></font></p>
