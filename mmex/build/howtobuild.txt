Building Money Manager Ex
--------------------------

=================
Microsoft Windows
=================

1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 C++ Express, which is a free download
2. Install the Platform SDK and make sure Visual Studio 2005 is correctly setup.
3. Install wxWidgets 2.6.3 and above in a directory like c:\pgmming\wxwidgets2.6.3 and then create an environment variable WXWIN to point to this directory.
Follow the instructions given by WxWidgets install on how to build it and build all build modes. 4 build modes are particulary important, Static Ansi Debug, Static Ansi Release, Static Unicode Debug, Static Unicode Release.
4. Open project under mmex directory and do a batch build of all modes neceesary
5. Copy currency.db3 from runtime directory into the appropriate build directories. Now you can run the project to launch the exe.
6. Static Ansi is used under Windows 95/98/Me
7. Static Unicode is used under Windows 2000/Windows XP/Windows 2003.

=================
Building on Linux
=================
	  a) Easiest way to configure these is on a Debian based Linux (Ubuntu for example) with apt-get or synaptic.
1) On a fresh machine. First install Ubuntu.
2) Install Dev Tools by the following: sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you are building on Ubuntu 6.10 follow section (3a) below
On other machines you might need to follow (3b)

===================================
UBUNTU 6.10 Instructions
===================================
3a) 1) Download the following packages
		libwxgtk2.6-0, libwxgtk2.6-dev, libsqlite3-0, libsqlite3-dev
	2) Get Bakefile debian package from the website and install it in the machine
	3) Modify the mmex\build\presets\wx_unix.bkl file and change the 
	    <default-value> /usr/lib/wx/config/gtk2-unicode-release-2.6</default-value>
		value to where you installed the libwxgtk2.6 script
	4) cd to the Build directory and 
		 "bakefile -f gnu mmex.bkl"
	5) "make -f GNUMakefile"
	6) copy the build/mmex file to the /mmex/runtime/ directory and launch it. 

===================================
More General Instructions
===================================
3b) Download latest wxWidgets for wxGTK and download and install.
	  1) Read the install directions in wxWidgets for how to do a build and then install the build on the machine. For eg wxWidgets has been built with --with-gtk --disable-shared --enable-unicode
	  2) After installation, wx-config will copied to the /usr/bin and can now correctly identify the command line params required.
	  3) Bakefile is required to be installed for processing this file. After getting the debian package install it by  "sudo dpkg ???  .deb"
	  4) Download SQLite3 source and build and then install it in the system. The file libsqlite3.a should be available in the standard lib path in the system. (for eg, /usr/lib)
	  5) Modify the mmex\build\presets\wx_unix.bkl file and change the 
	  <default-value> /usr/lib/wx/config/gtk2-unicode-release-2.6</default-value>
	  to the default setting for wxWidgets configuration, which is wx-config by default.
	  6) Run bakefile "bakefile -f gnu mmex.bkl"
	  7) Run make by "make -f GNUMakefile". This should build all the targets.

Windows Installer Setup
------------------------
MMEX uses innosetup to create installer packages.
The script is checked into mmex\install directory
