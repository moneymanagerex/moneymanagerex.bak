		*** Build instructions for MS Windows platform ***


You can build MMEx on Windows using VisualC++ 2003 or later, or MinGW with GCC.
Firstly you can run mmex/bootstrap.bat which will refresh makefiles and projects.
Bakefile must be installed to do that. But you can skip this step if you just want 
to build sources.


WARNING: all files in this directory generated from bakefile's scripts (..\bakefiles). 
         Do not modify these files and never commit them to svn. All changes will be lost 
         if bootstrap.bat will rerun!!! These files should be commited only if you changed
         some bakefile scripts and run bootstrap.bat to refresh content of this directory.



	*** Prerequisites ***


1. Install wxWidgets 2.8.10 and above in a directory like C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10 
   and then create an environment variable WXWIN to point to that directory.

2. Follow the instructions given by WxWidgets install on how to build it.
   Build these configurations: Unicode Release, Unicode Debug, Release, Debug
   (or only those you need).

3. Install Boost C++ Libraries and create an environment variable BOOSTDIR
   that points to directory where Boost were installed.

4. Install GNU GetText for Windows, http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm. 
   This software requires to generate binary translation files from .po files.
   Append path to bin folder of installed software to PATH environment variable
   (usually "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin").

5. To build installation (setup) of MMEX download and install InnoSetup Quick Start Pack
   (which includes InnoSetup itself and Inno Setup Preprocessor). Append path to folder 
   of installed software (something like a "C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5")
   to PATH environment variable.



	*** Compiling using VisualC++ command prompt *** 


1.Open "Visual Studio 200X Command Prompt".
2.Change working directory to mmex\build\msw.
3.Edit config.vc to select build options (Ansi\Unicode, Debug\Release, Static\Shared, etc.).
4.Type in command prompt
  nmake -f makefile.vc
  or if you don't like to edit config.vc, type something like that
  nmake -f makefile.vc WX_DEBUG=1 CPU=AMD64
5.Run tests (you can skip this step)
  nmake -f makefile.vc sub_check
6.nmake -f makefile.vc install (optionally)
7.Build installation (if InnoSetup installed)
  nmake -f makefile.vc sub_setup

  This is the most preferable way to build MMEX using VC++.



	*** Compiling using VisualStudio IDE *** 


1. Open build\msw\mmex.sln under mmex directory.
   Select one of following configurations to build (accordingly to wxWidgets builds):
   
   Unicode builds, for Windows 2000 or later
   "Unicode Release Multilib WX_PYTHON_0" <-- choice number one for most people
   "Unicode Debug Multilib WX_PYTHON_0"

   Ansi builds, for Windows 95/98/Me.
   "Release Multilib WX_PYTHON_0" 
   "Debug Multilib WX_PYTHON_0"

   To build unit tests use solution build\msw\tests\mmex_tests.sln. Build tests, 
   copy mmex_tests.exe to mmex\runtime and run one.

2. IDE cannot translate files from mmex\runtime\en\*.po. You should use one of makefiles
   in that directory to build translations. For example, run Visual Studio Command Prompt,
   change dir to mmex\runtime\en and type "nmake -f makefile.vc".
   The same you should do to build setup in mmex\setup\win32.



	*** Compiling using MinGW *** 


1.Install the latest version of MinGW, GCC compiler and mingw-make for it.
  Add environment variable MINGWDIR which points to directory of MinGW.

2.Build wxWidgets library using gcc from MinGW. Use these options in config.gcc:
  SHARED ?= 0
  MONOLITHIC ?= 1 
  USE_QA ?= 1

3.You can create mingw.bat file to run gcc with next content (assume MinGW installed in "C:\bin\MinGW")

  set MINGWDIR=C:\bin\MinGW
  set PATH=%MINGWDIR%\bin;C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5
  mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc %* 2>mingw.log

4.Edit config.gcc to select build options (Ansi\Unicode, Debug\Release, Static\Shared, etc.).
5.mingw.bat
6.mingw.bat check (executes some tests)
7.mingw.bat install (optionally)
8.mingw.bat setup (if InnoSetup installed)


	
	*** Building 64-bit MMEX using Visual C++ *** 


  64-bit tools are not available on Visual C++ Express Edition by default. To enable 64-bit tools 
  on VC++ Express, install the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) in addition to VC++ Express.
  Otherwise, an error occurs when you attempt to configure a project to target a 64-bit platform.

1.As usually, firstly you should build wxWidgets. 
  Run Visual Studio Command Prompt x64 (or IA-64), change dir to wxWidgets\build\msw.
  Edit config.vc and set TARGET_CPU to your system's CPU (AMD64 in most cases).
  Run nmake -f makefile.vc 
  and you will build libraries at wxWidgets\lib\vc_amd64_lib.

2.Change dir to trunk\mmex\build\msw, set TARGET_CPU in config.vc and type
  nmake -f makefile.vc again. After this your will get 64-bit MMEX :-)



	*** Your compiler do not present in this document *** 


This means someone should modify bakefile build scripts to add output for your compiler.
Currently bakefile can generate makefiles\projects for these compilers (run bakefile --help)

    borland       Borland C/C++ makefiles
    dmars         Digital Mars makefiles
    dmars_smake   Digital Mars makefiles for SMAKE
    gnu           GNU toolchain makefiles (Unix)
    mingw         MinGW makefiles (mingw32-make)
    msevc4prj     MS eMbedded Visual C++ 4 project files
    msvc          MS Visual C++ nmake makefiles
    msvc6prj      MS Visual C++ 6.0 project files
    msvs2003prj   MS Visual Studio 2003 project files
    msvs2005prj   MS Visual Studio 2005 project files
    msvs2008prj   MS Visual Studio 2008 project files
    symbian       Symbian development files
    watcom        OpenWatcom makefiles
    xcode2        Xcode 2.4 project files

The mmex build scripts resides in mmex\build\bakefiles. 
Firstly modify Bakefiles.bkgen to add missing output formats.
Append new format to tag <add-formats> and add flag to makefile's output directory.
If you are lucky, you will get makefile\project for your compiler after running mmex\bootstrap[.bat].
