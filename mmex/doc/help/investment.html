This is the opening 'Home Screen' for MMEX. As you can see, it shows an
overview of current account balances and income/expenses for the month. To start
tracking investments, you first have to create an 'investment account'.
<p><br>

<br>

<br>
These are the simple screens you use to set up an account.<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
Once you finish, you're taken back to the 'Home Screen'. Notice that the new
investment account 'ML: Roth IRA' shows under 'Stocks' on the left-hand nav bar.<br>
<br>
When you click on an account, you are taken to the account page. For
checking/savings, this is where you view and enter transactions. For an
investment account, it's where you view and edit holdings.<br>
<p><img border="0" src="stockinvestment.jpg" width="450" height="324">
<br>
<br>
When you click 'New' you get a pop-up box to enter holding information.<br>

<br>
<br>
And this is what your holding/s will look like in the account screen.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="stock_view.jpg" width="450" height="324">
<br>
If you click 'Stocks' on the left-hand nav bar, you'll see an overview of all
your investment account holdings.<br>

<br>
<br>
And the 'Home Screen' will reflect the value of your stock holdings.<br>
