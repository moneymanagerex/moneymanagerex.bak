<p>
<font face="Verdana">Money Manager Exª is a free,
easy-to-use personal finance software to manage your money. It
primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when
and how the money
goes and comes.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana">Think of Money Manager Ex (<b>MMEX</b>)
as a computer checkbook which enables you to
balance your accounts, organize, manage and generate reports for your
finances.
</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana">It is also a great way to keep
abreast of your financial worth.
</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana">The primary goal of MMEX is to
simplify the process of tracking financial
information without making it complex like some of the popular personal
finance software packages.

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="better">Working
towards better Financial Health</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Becoming organized
financially requires some amount of discipline. Financial management
becomes complicated because
there is no clear understanding of cash flow or an idea of income
against
expenses. Debt
is usually what results when expenses exceed income.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The first step towards better financial organization is keeping good
records.
Only when there is recognition of the expenses being made on a day to
day basis
will there be an understanding on how to cut back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Did you realize you spent
600$ in buying DVD movies last year? How many times
did you watch them? Do you think now that the 600$ would have been
better spent
on the unexpected maintenance on the auto that came up yesterday? Of
course
there is no right or wrong answer to how you should spend your money.
After all,
it is you who earned that money and the right to spend it whichever way
you see
fit. But you can always make your money work harder for you. You want
better
"bang for your buck/lira/pound".<br>
<br>
Here's where personal finance software comes in. They help you
slice/dice the
financial data to give you better insight into what is going on. Always
remember
the software can only be as good as the data it has to process. Garbage
In Garbage Out. But if you have started thinking of even using a
Personal finance
software you are well on your way to making every dollar
count.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="concepts">Money
Manager Ex Concepts</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Money Manager Ex models the
real financial world through concepts of
transactions. A <b><i>transaction</i></b>is an
financial
event where money/services are
exchanged. Such transactions could be making a payment towards a loan,
buying a
car, eating out at a restaurant and so on. Each transaction is
associated with
an <i>account</i> and a <i>category</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<font face="Verdana"><img src="mmex_concept.png">
</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">An <b><i>account
</i></b> is a record of
what you either own or owe. For example,
your checking account is a record of cash on deposit in the bank that
is
available for writing checks or for making ATM withdrawals or for
making debit
transactions using a debit card. A credit card account is a record of
the money
you owe to a credit card company for the use of the credit card. All
transactions either increase or decrease the balance in one or more
accounts.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A <i style="font-weight: bold;">category</i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>is a record of
where the money comes from or goes to. For
example, salary is an income category for recording the money you earn
from your
job. Dining is an expense category you might use to record the cost of
eating
out. Categories make it possible to track how you earn and spend
money.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To make MMEX work
effectively, it is important to record all transactions
made by you into the appropriate accounts. Even if you do not have the
habit of
carefully entering transactions, you should enter transactions when you
get your
monthly statement from your credit card company or bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Once you enter your
transactions, MMEX can help provide some useful
information to you. For example, it will tell you what the current
balance on
your accounts are. It will provide information on how much you are
spending
versus how much you are earning. All this knowledge would help you make
better
decisions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To begin working with Money
Manager, you should start by creating a new
database file. All the transactions you record with MMEX are stored in
a
database file (file with an extension of .mmb) on your hard disk. This
file
contains all the components- accounts, categories, transactions that
make up
your financial status.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Although it is possible to
create more than one MMEX data file, it isn't
usually necessary. One file can hold all your transactions and
accounts. There
is no limit to the number of accounts or transactions that you can have
in your
database file. The only time it might make sense to have more than one
database
file is if you use MMEX to organize your personal finance and the
finances of
the small business firm you have. Or if you share the computer with
another
person and your maintain separate financial records from them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<font face="Verdana"><br>
</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="database">Creating
a Database</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">To create a new database
file, on the Menu, Select File-&gt;New Database.
This will prompt you to specify the location of the .mmb file. Once you
select
the location a new database is created. You can now see the database
name on the title bar which helps remind you which database file is
open.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tips:&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>1) Remember to make
backups of your .mmb.&nbsp;<br>
2) The .mmb file is&nbsp;not encrypted. That
means anyone else having the proper know how can actually open the file
and read
the contents. So make sure that if you are storing any sensitive
financial
information it is properly guarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<h5><font face="Verdana"><a href="#top">Back

<font face="Verdana"><br>
</font>
<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="accounts">Creating
new accounts</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Right after you create a new
database file, the first thing to do is to
create a new account. Currently, MMEX supports two types of accounts.
One type of account is those that support
three kinds of transactions, withdrawal, deposit and transfers. This
account is
termed a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Checking</span>"
account. These kinds of
accounts cover common bank accounts, checking accounts, savings
accounts, cash
accounts and credit card accounts. The other type of account is a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Investment</span>"
account. This is a type of account which allows you to track stocks and
other investments you may own.<br>
<br>
To properly setup accounts, you should have
balance information for the the accounts you want to add to MMEX. You
can get
this information from your most recent bank, investment and credit card
statements.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To create a new account, on
the Menu, Select Accounts-&gt;New Account. This
will bring up the create account dialog window. You can create a new
account by
filling in the details.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The required fields are the name of the account and the currency you
want to
use. The recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in
relation to the
real world account. Say for example you have an account with CitiBank,
you could
name your account "CitiBank".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The only type of account that is currently supported is checking
accounts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To track additional
information about this account, optionally you can enter
your account details such as Account Number, Held At, Website, Contact
info and
Access Info. You can enter additional notes about the account in the
notes
field.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Most accounts have some kind
of balance in them, for example say in a credit
card account, you have a current balance of 2304.67$, you could put
that value
in the initial balance field. Going forward you only need to add
transactions
beyond that date when you had the balance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Accounts have status associated with them which could "Open" or
"Closed". Closed accounts are just that. They are no longer active.
Setting this status is just a way to de clutter your view so that you
do not
have to see the closed accounts in your tree view navigation pane.<br>
<br>
In addition you can set the currency that is associated with your
account. MMEX
comes with a default set of currencies which you can add to correspond
to your
countries currency settings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">You also can mark accounts
as a 'Favorite Account'. This again is used to
change the accounts that are visible in the navigation bar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The other type of account
that MMEX supports is an "Investment"
Account. These accounts are store information on financial institutions
where
you hold any type of stock/bonds/mutual funds investments.</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="editaccounts">Editing
Account Information</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Once you have created an
account, you can edit any of the account information
fields by selecting the account name in the navigation pane and then
right click
to bring up the popup menu. Select "Edit Account" to bring up the
account information dialog. Edit the information and then click "OK"
to save the account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="trans">Creating
new Transactions</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Once you have created a new
account, one can start entering transactions.
Select the account you want to enter transactions into by left clicking
the
account in the navigation tree. This opens the register of transactions
associated with this account. To create a new transaction, click the
"New" button to open up the transaction dialog. Enter the details
associated with this transactions. Select by selecting type of
transaction from
"Withdrawal", "Deposit" or "Transfer". Then select
the payee, category, the transaction date, number, any notes and then
the
transaction amount. Press "OK" button to save the transaction.<br>
<br>
Here are some notes on the fields associated with the transaction
dialog.<br>
<!--added consistancey to list terry wick 9/14/2007 -->
<b><i>Transaction Types:</i></b>
<ul>
	<li><i><b> Withdrawal transaction type:</i></b> is one
where one makes an expense.</li>
	<li><i><b>Deposit transaction type:</i></b> is an income transaction.</li>
	<li><i><b>Transfer transaction type:</i></b> is one where a withdrawal is
 made from one account and is deposited into another account.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Payee:</i></b> Payee is to whom the money goes or comes from.
<ul>
	<li>Clicking the payee button opens up the payee dialog.
You can select the payee from that dialog or create a new payee.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Category:</i></b> Category selects
the kind of expense/income for the transaction.
<ul>
	<li>Clicking the category button opens up the category dialog. You can select the
category from the dialog or create a new category.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Transaction Number:</i></b> is a field to enter any kind of number associated with
the transaction like check number.
<br>
<b><i>Transaction Status:</i></b> Select from "Unreconciled", "Reconciled", "Void",
"Flag for Followup" status options.  This marks the transaction into various states.
<ul>
	<li><i><b>Unreconciled:</i></b> When you enter a transaction, it initially is in the state of
"Unreconciled". Which means the transaction has not been reconciled with your bank/credit card
company's balance.</li>
	<li><i><b>Reconciled:</i></b> Once the transaction is checked and verified with a credit card
company's balance information, it can be marked as reconciled.</li>
	<li><i><b>Void:</i></b> If you entered a transaction that later became invalid or you canceled
the transaction, instead of deleting the transaction you can also mark it as void so you have a
record of the transaction.</li>
	<li><i><b>Flag For Followup:</i></b> This status marks transactions as needing more action.
For example, you receive a balance statement from the financial institution and you notice that
the transaction amount is different between what you recorded and what is in the statement.
You can mark it as flag for follow up so that you can followup with the financial instituton.</li>

a transaction can be considered reconciled if the details of the
transaction match that from the financial institution. Then the
transaction can be marked as reconciled. By marking these transactions
you can keep track whether the transactions you are entering match the
actual transactions. In MMEX, reconciled and unreconciled transactions
are shown by different icons.

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="importCSV">Importing
From CSV Files</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">MMEX can import from a wide
variety of formats. One of them is a fixed format CSV file. This file
format exactly matches the CSV format that MMEX can export. So it can
be useful to move data from one .mmb database file to another .mmb
database file. To easily see the format of the CSV file, you can try
exporting an account to a CSV file and then analysing the format
created.<br>
<br>
The general format is as follows:<br>
<b><i>Date</i></b> - Date of the transaction
(Displayed in the format specified in Options-&gt;DateFormat)<br>
<i><b>Payee</b></i> - To whom the transaction
was made. In the case of a transfer transaction, this indicates the
name of the account from which the transfer was made or to the account
the transfer was made.<br>
<b><i>Transaction Type</i></b> - This can
either be "<i>Withdrawal</i>" or "<i>Deposit</i>"<br>
<b><i>Amount</i></b> - The transaction amount
as a positive value<br>
<b><i>Category</i></b> - The category of the
transaction<br>
<b><i>SubCategory</i></b> - The subcategory of
the transaction if any (otherwise blank)<br>
<b><i>Number</i></b> - Transaction Number<br>
<b><i>Notes</i></b> - Transaction Notes<br>
<br>
Note that the transactions from a CSV file can only be imported into a
single MMEX account.<br>
</font></p>
<br>
<font face="Verdana"><a href="#top">Back

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="importQIF">Importing
From QIF Files</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quicken Interchange Format
(QIF) is an open specification for reading and writing financial data
to media (i.e. files). A QIF file typically has the following structure:<br>
<br>
!Type:type identifier string<br>
[single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
...<br>
^<br>
[single character line code]Literal String Data<br>
...<br>
^<br>
<br>
Each record ends with a ^ (caret). <br>
See example QIF transaction <br>
<br>
!Type:Bank Header<br>
D6/ 1/94 Date <br>
T-1,000.00 Amount<br>
N1005 number<br>
PBank Of Mortgage Payee <br>
^ End of transaction <br>
<br>
QIF is older than Open Financial Exchange (OFX). The inability to
reconcile imported transactions against the current account information
is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. It is commonly supported by
financial institutions to supply downloadable information to account
holders. <br>
<br>
MMEX can import transactions from specific types of QIF formats into an
account.
<br>
<br>
The types are the following: (You can find the type of QIF by opening
in a text editor) <br>
!Type:Bank Bank account transactions <br>
!Type:Cash Cash account transactions <br>
!Type:CCard Credit card account transactions <br>
<br>
<b>Important Note (1)</b>: The date format option has to
match that of the date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing
by MMEX will fail and will result in transactions having incorrect
dates. <br>
<br>
<b>Important Note (2)</b>: After importing from QIF, all
transactions
will have a "Follow Flag" as it its status.
You can mark all transactions with this flag using the bulk status
setting commands using the right click menu in the account view. </font>

<p><font face="Verdana">MMEX can also import from
CSV files that are exported from the Money Manager.NET program. This is
to primarily help users of that program migrate to using MMEX. <br>
<br>
The general format is as follows:<br>
<b><i>Date</i></b> - Date of the transaction
(Displayed in the format specified in Options-&gt;DateFormat)<br>

</font><font face="Verdana"> <b><i>Category</i></b>
- The category of the transaction. This is actually a compound string

From Universal CSV Format</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">To alleviate the problem of
users having to preformat their bank transaction CSV files into
the fixed format MMEX requires, MMEX also allows users to import CSV
files where the order of fields is
completely freeform. To use this importer, select the account you want
to import into and then select
the order of fields in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the
list of possible fields.
MMEX will now import the CSV file using the format information
specified by the user.
MMEX can import from a wide variety of formats. One of them is a fixed
format CSV file. This file format exactly matches the CSV format that
MMEX can export. So it can be useful to move data from one .mmb

<i><b>Payee</b></i> - To whom the transaction
was made. In the case of a transfer transaction, this indicates the
name of the account from which the transfer was made or to the account

<b><i>Amount (+/-)</i></b> - The transaction
amount. If it is a positive value it is a deposit, negative value is a
withdrawal.<br>
<b><i>Category</i></b> - The category of the

considered as a deposit. (Do not use if specifying Amount (+/-))<br>
<b><i>Don't Care</i></b> - Ignore this field<br>
<br>
Note that the transactions from a CSV file can only be imported into a
single MMEX account.<br>
<br>
<b>Important Note (1)</b>: The date format option has to
match that of the date format in the QIF file, otherwise, date parsing
by MMEX will fail and will result in transactions having incorrect
dates. <br>
<br>
<b>Important Note (2)</b>: After importing from QIF, all
transactions
will have a "Follow Flag" as it its status.
You can mark all transactions with this flag using the bulk status
setting commands using the right click menu in the account view.</font></p>

for creating CSV Files</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">
<br>
<ul>
	<li>When creating your CSV file be sure that you remove the commas
from your deposits and withdrawals.  This can be done easily through a
program such as Excel or OpenOffice Calc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Or you can change the delimiter to be used by MMEX
by choosing Tools > Options and changing the "Import/Export
Settings" in the "General" option settings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You do not need to include balance values in your CSV
File.</li></ul>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="exportcsv">Exporting
to CSV Files</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">MMEX can export to a fixed
format CSV file. This file format exactly matches the CSV format that
MMEX can import. So it can be useful to move data from one .mmb
database file to another .mmb database file. To easily see the format
of the CSV file, you can try exporting an account to a CSV file and
then analysing the format created.<br>
<br>
The general format is as follows:<br>
<b><i>Date</i></b> - Date of the transaction
(Displayed in the format specified in Options-&gt;DateFormat)<br>
<i><b>Payee</b></i> - To whom the transaction
was made. In the case of a transfer transaction, this indicates the
name of the account from which the transfer was made or to the account
the transfer was made.<br>
<b><i>Transaction Type</i></b> - This can
either be "<i>Withdrawal</i>" or "<i>Deposit</i>"<br>
<b><i>Amount</i></b> - The transaction amount
as a positive value<br>
<b><i>Category</i></b> - The category of the
transaction<br>
<b><i>SubCategory</i></b> - The subcategory of
the transaction if any (otherwise blank)<br>
<b><i>Notes</i></b> - Transaction Notes<br>
<br>
Note that the transactions from an account can be exported to a single
CSV file.<br>

of MMEX by changing the options in the Options Dialog. <br>
<br>
<b><i> General-&amp;gtCurrency </i> </b>
The base currency setting is used to
display the total of all accounts.
<br>
<b><i> General-&amp;gtDate Format </i> </b>
The date format setting is used to
control how dates should be displayed and also how dates should be
parsed when importing QIF, CSV files.
<br>
<b><i> General-&amp;gtCSV Limiter </i> </b>
This is used as the delimiting character when parsing CSV files. This
is useful to modify from the default ',' when dealing with currencies
that use ',' to denote decimal points in amounts.
<br>
<b><i> General-&amp;gtLanguage </i> </b>
This is the language used by the MMEX GUI. MMEX might require a restart
before
all GUI elements have the new language.
<br>
<b><i> <br>
View Options-&gt;Account Visible </i> </b> This
determines which accounts are seen in the Navigation tree.
<br>
<b><i> View Options-&gt;Transactions Visible </i>
</b> This determines which transactions are seen in the Account
View.
<br>
<b><i> <br>
Colors</i> </b> Allows the user to modify colors in MMEX
to suit his/her style.
<br>
<b><i> <br>
Others-&gt; Backup Database</i> </b> MMEX will make a
backup of the file before opening it. There will be only one backup
made and it will
be overwritten next time MMEX is opened. So if you want to keep a
certain backup permanently, you need to do a manual backup.
<br>
<b><i> Others-&gt; Stock Quote Link</i> </b>
For stock investments, given a URL, MMEX can show the page
automatically when the webpage button is clicked.
Specify the URL here. The default is for Google's finance.

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="nameex">What's
the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</a></font></h3>
<p>
<font face="Verdana">Originally I developed a personal
finance software called Money Manager. It was written in .NET and more
of a learning excercise than serious software development. It grew far
beyond the original design.
The software was frozen and work began on a new version which had a
similar user interface and features, but written in C++.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana">Usually Microsoft names their second
version of their improved software APIs with an Ex extension as in
doSomething() and doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and
tacked on a 'Ex'
to the end.

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="database">Is
my data safe? Is the .mmb format proprietary?<!--</a--></a></font></h3>
<p>
<font face="Verdana"><a name="database">Yes,
your data is completely safe.
And, No, .mmb file is not proprietary. MMEX uses SQLite databases to
store user data. That means that
the .mmb file is a regular SQLite database. SQLite is one of the
smallest, free relational database systems
around and there are tons of tools to open and access sqlite databases.
SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/)
are two such utilities. Once you open the database using these tools,
you can do anything you want
with the data. </a></font></p>
<h5><font face="Verdana"><a href="#top">Back

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="usbkey">Can
MMEX run from a USB Key?<!--</a--></a></font></h3>
<p>
<font face="Verdana"><a name="usbkey">
<p>Yes,
MMEX is a portable application which means ability to run
without installation, for example, from USB flash drive.
If MMEX finds mmexini.db3 in its folder, it assumes portable mode.
Copy mmex's files to USB Key and copy yours mmexini.db3 to
mmex's folder on that drive.</p>
<p>To make MMEX portable:</p>
<p>1. On Windows (assume F:\ is USB flash drive)</p>
<p>&nbsp Copy "C:\Program Files\MoneyManagerEx" to F:\<BR>
&nbsp Copy "%APPDATA%\MoneyManagerEx\mmexini.db3" to F:\MoneyManagerEx<BR>
&nbsp Copy your database file to any folder on F:\</p>
<p>2. On Unix (assume /media/disk is mounted USB flash drive)</p>
<p>&nbsp Compile mmex from sources as usually, and</p>
&nbsp make install prefix=/media/disk<BR>
&nbsp cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex
<p>&nbsp or if you want to copy mmex which has already installed in /usr</p>
<p>&nbsp cp /usr/bin/mmex /media/disk/mmex/bin<BR>
&nbsp cp /usr/share/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share<BR>
&nbsp cp /usr/share/doc/mmex /media/disk/mmex/share/doc<BR>
&nbsp cp ~/.mmex/mmexini.db3 /media/disk/mmex/share/mmex</p>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="safety">How
do I know MMEX is not trying to steal my sensitive financial
information?<!--</a--></a></font></h3>
<p>
<font face="Verdana"><a name="safety">
Generally, with any closed source program, you have to depend upon the
vendor's word regarding safety of the data.
But with MMEX being open source, you can verify this claim yourself.
Even if you are not a C++ expert, you can rest assured
that anyone can access the source code at any time and verify the
legitimacy of MMEX's intentions. MMEX does not connect to the internet
unless you explicitly asked it do so (like checking for an update etc).

transactions from any arbitary set of criteria, use the transaction
filter to select the transactions you want and then do a print from the
