<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Money Manager Ex&ordf; is a free, easy-to-use
personal finance software to manage your money. It primarily helps
organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when and how the
money goes and comes.&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Think of Money Manager Ex (<B>MMEX</B>) as a
computer checkbook which enables you to balance your accounts,
organize, manage and generate reports for your finances. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">It is also a great way to keep abreast of
your financial worth. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The primary goal of MMEX is to simplify the
process of tracking financial information without making it complex
like some of the popular personal finance software packages. </FONT>
</P>
<P><!-- new section added by Terry Wick  9/16/2007 --><FONT FACE="Verdana">The
purpose of this manual is to give you some basic instructions for
using MMEX. This instruction manual will evolve as the program
evolves. So check the help system with each update and see what's new
and how to better utilize MMEX. </FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Becoming organized financially requires some
amount of discipline. Financial management becomes complicated
because there is no clear understanding of cash flow or an idea of
income against expenses. Debt is usually what results when expenses
exceed income.&nbsp;<BR><BR>The first step towards better financial
organization is keeping good records. Only when there is recognition
of the expenses being made on a day to day basis will there be an
understanding on how to cut back.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Did you realize you spent $600 in buying DVD
movies last year? How many times did you watch them? Do you think now
that the $600 would have been better spent on the unexpected
maintenance on the auto that came up yesterday? Of course there is no
right or wrong answer to how you should spend your money. After all,
it is you who earned that money and the right to spend it whichever
way you see fit. But you can always make your money work harder for
you. You want better &quot;bang for your buck/lira/pound&quot;.<BR><BR>Here's
where personal finance software comes in. They help you slice/dice
the financial data to give you better insight into what is going on.
Always remember the software can only be as good as the data it has
to process. Garbage In Garbage Out. But if you have started thinking
of even using a Personal finance software you are well on your way to
making every dollar count.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Read on how to work with Money Manager Ex.</FONT></P>

<HR>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="concepts"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">Money
Manager Ex Concepts</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Money Manager Ex models the real financial
world through concepts of transactions. A <I><B>transaction </B></I>is
a financial event where money/services are exchanged. Such
transactions could be making a payment towards a loan, buying a car,
eating out at a restaurant and so on. Each transaction is associated
with an <I>account</I> and a <I>category</I>.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="mmex_concept.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=540 HEIGHT=317 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">An <B>A</B><I><B>ccount</B></I> is a record
of what you either own or owe. <BR>For example, your checking account
is a record of the cash deposited in the bank, that is available for
writing checks, making ATM withdrawals or for making debit
transactions using a debit card. A credit card account is a record of
the money you owe to a credit card company when you make a payment
using the credit card. All transactions either increase or decrease
the balance in one or more accounts.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A <I><B>category</B></I> is a classification
of where the money comes from or goes to.<BR>For example, your salary
is the money you earn from your job and is a type of income. The
money received from an investment as interest is also a type of
income. These would have a <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">category</SPAN>
of <B>Income</B>, with <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">subcategories
</SPAN>of <B>Salary</B> and <B>Investment Interest</B>.<BR>If you
wanted to find out the cost of eating out, how much you spend on
groceries, how much is spent on fuel for your car and how much your
car is costing you in maintenance, you would create expense
categories and subcategories as follows:<BR>Create the category of
<B>Food</B> with subcategories of <B>Groceries</B> and <B>Dining Out</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
and for</SPAN> the car set up a category of <B>Car</B> with
subcategories of <B>Fuel</B> and <B>Maintenance</B>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Categories make it possible to track how you
earn and spend money.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">We can also look at MMEX as a system that
records the flow and amount of money you have.<BR>The Accounts record
where the money is. Money comes in as <B>deposits</B> (Income), goes
out as <B>withdrawals</B> (expense), and money moving within the
system as <B>transfers</B>. (credit cards payments)<BR>For example,
money is put into your savings account form your <B>Employer</B> as a
salary. Money goes out of your Credit card account when you purchase
groceries from the <B>Supermarket</B> with your credit card. Money
transfers from your savings to your credit card when you repay your
credit card. Money also goes out when making cash payments for your
groceries at the <B>Corner Store</B>.<BR>This is where MMEX also
requires <B>Payees</B>, where the payees are the Supermarket, Corner
Store and Employer. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">A <B>Payee</B> is who the money comes from or
goes to. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To make MMEX work effectively, it is
important to record all transactions made by you into the appropriate
accounts. Even if you do not have the habit of carefully entering
transactions, you should enter transactions when you get your monthly
statement from your credit card company or bank.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Once you enter your transactions, MMEX can
help provide some useful information to you. For example, it will
tell you what the current balance on your accounts are. It will
provide information on how much you are spending versus how much you
are earning. All this knowledge would help you make better decisions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To begin working with Money Manager, you
should start by creating a new database file. All the transactions
you record with MMEX are stored in a database file (file with an
extension of .mmb) on your hard disk. This file contains all the
components- accounts, categories, transactions that make up your
financial status.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Although it is possible to create more than
one MMEX data file, it isn't usually necessary. One file can hold all
your transactions and accounts. There is no limit to the number of
accounts or transactions that you can have in your database file. The
only time it might make sense to have more than one database file is
if you use MMEX to organize your personal finance and the finances of
the small business firm you have. Or if you share the computer with
another person and your maintain separate financial records from
them.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

Name:</B></FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana">This is a required field. The
recommendation is to name your accounts uniquely and in relation to
real world accounts.<BR>Example: With CitiBank, we have a Savings
account and a credit card Visa account. You could name your accounts
as &quot;CitiBank Savings&quot; and &ldquo;Citibank Visa&rdquo;.</FONT></P>

account, optionally you can enter your account details such as
Account Number, Held At, Website, Contact info and Access Info. You
can enter additional notes about the account in the notes field.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Most accounts have some kind of balance in
them, for example say in a credit card account, you have a current
balance of $2304.67, you could put that value in the initial balance
field. Going forward you only need to add transactions beyond that
date when you had the balance.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Accounts have status
associated with them which could be &quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Closed&quot;.
Closed accounts are just that. They are no longer active. Setting
this status is just a way to de-clutter your view in your tree view
navigation pane. By changing the View Options on the Menu,
Tools-&gt;Options, you can hide the closed accounts. <BR><BR><B>Currency:</B>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">This is initially set to the
database currency setting. This is initially set when creating the
database.<BR>Y</SPAN>ou can set the currency that is associated with
your account. MMEX comes with a default set of currencies which you
can use, to correspond to your countries currency settings.<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Example:
If you have an account in a different country, changing the currency
for the account will allow you to track the value for that account in
your own country.</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">You also can mark accounts as a 'Favorite
Account'. This again is used to change the accounts that are visible
in the navigation bar.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The Term Account is similar to Checking
Accounts with the exception that they appear in their own section on
the home page and can be shown or hidden for normal day usage. For a
better explanation see the <A HREF="#accountsetup">account setup
example</A>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">The other type of account that MMEX supports
is an &quot;Investment&quot; Account. These accounts are store

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="nameex"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">What's
the reason for the EX in the name of the software?</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Originally I developed a personal finance
software called Money Manager. It was written in .NET and more of a
learning excercise than serious software development. It grew far
beyond the original design. The software was frozen and work began on
a new version which had a similar user interface and features, but
written in C++.&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">Usually Microsoft names their second version
of their improved software APIs with an Ex extension as in
doSomething() and doSomethingEx(). So I just followed the model and
tacked on a 'Ex' to the end. </FONT>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="database1"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">Is
my data safe? Is the .mmb format proprietary?<!--</a--></FONT></H3>
<P><A NAME="database2"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, your data is
completely safe. And, No, .mmb file is not proprietary. MMEX uses
SQLite databases to store user data. That means that the .mmb file is
a regular SQLite database. SQLite is one of the smallest, free
relational database systems around and there are tons of tools to
open and access sqlite databases. SQLiteSpy and SQLite Browser
(http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) are two such utilities. Once
you open the database using these tools, you can do anything you want
with the data. </FONT>

MMEX run from a USB Key?<!--</a--></FONT></H3>
<P><A NAME="usbkey1"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">Yes, MMEX is a portable
application which means ability to run without installation, for
example, from USB flash drive. If MMEX finds mmexini.db3 in its
folder, it assumes portable mode. Copy mmex's files to USB Key and
copy yours mmexini.db3 to mmex's folder on that drive.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">To make MMEX portable:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">1. On Windows (assume F:\ is USB flash drive)</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="safety1"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana">Generally, with any
closed source program, you have to depend upon the vendor's word
regarding safety of the data. But with MMEX being open source, you
can verify this claim yourself. Even if you are not a C++ expert, you
can rest assured that anyone can access the source code at any time
and verify the legitimacy of MMEX's intentions. MMEX does not connect
to the internet unless you explicitly asked it do so (like checking
for an update etc). </FONT>
