0.7.4
  - Including cstring explicitly for tests to compile, after GCC changes as of 4.4.5

0.7.1
  - Small changes to docs. NO funcitionality updates.

0.7.0
  - First swipe at documentation
 
  - Went all original and stuff and added the __TOTAL__ conext variable,
    so it is possible to print out "X of Y" in a loop, as in
    __COUNT__ of __TOTAL__.

0.6.8
  - Reworked parsing logic, to accomodate future, more complex syntax (ESCAPE,
    for example)

  - Includes will now be included either as an absolute path, or relative to the
    parent include. In the past, the inlude paths had to be relative to the
    binary using the library.
