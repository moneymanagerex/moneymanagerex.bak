SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The code is tested against LINUX and WINDOWS. The Visual Studio project file is
in the folder named vs/

================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION
Under docs/ as well as on the World Wide Webbb:
  http://nulidex.com/code/docs/html_template/

MAJOR DIFFERENCES with HTML::Template
* There are no switches to enable/disable features, such as loop context
variables or globals. Everything is enabled by default. 

================================================================================
CREATING TESTS

1. Create a template file in t/

2. Add the test to run(), creating a separate container if this is a test for
   a new type of features.

3. Create the reference output file: 
   $ ./test create t/my_new_test.tmpl
   
4. Inspect t/my_new_test.txt to make sure the output is correct.
   This will be used now as a regression test.

5. Recompile and run the test binary.

================================================================================
RUNNING TESTS

$ ./test

OR for one test

$ ./test run t/my_test.tmpl

================================================================================
EXAMPLES

An example is in the examples/ directory. The makefile is for Linux only.
